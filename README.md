# Learning Journey
The hard way of doing things. 
Learning new things, especially programming, is fascinating
Can get overwhelming sometimes
But I get to be patient with myself
Life is too short to want to make every mistake on your own
The reason many men have gone ahead of us.
And their perspectives they've captured on tape
Written on the pages of books
So we can dodge the consequences of unrecovery that they have felt....
